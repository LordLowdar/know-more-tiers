# Know More Tiers
## Description:

---
As an adult, have you ever had trouble trying to find new friends?
Trying to find people with similar hobbies and interests to yourself?
Do you like to make Tierlistâ€™s of your favorite hobbies?
Are you looking for a website that's like a dating website but for friends?
Then we have the website for you!

In a fast paced each changing and evolving world of social networking, dating, food ordering apps, it's rare for people to connect strictly through common interests. Know More Tiers intends to fill that space, by allowing its members to make a tier list for their activities, by rating them from S (super) all the way down to D (below average). After users have selected activities and rated them, they are then matched with other users based on matching interests.
